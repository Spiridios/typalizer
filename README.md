# typalizer
A mobile friendly interactive Pokemon type chart that can show combined weaknesses and strengths for multi-type Pokemon.

Deployed at [https://spiridios.github.io/typalizer/](https://spiridios.github.io/typalizer/)

# How to use
Tap or click on any of the defense types to get a combined defense rating. For example, tapping on Normal and Ghost will show in the combined column that the mon is immune to Normal, Fighting, and Ghost attacks, resists by 50% (1/2) Poison and Bug, and is vulnerable (2x) to Dark.

Tap or click on any of the attack types to highlight the attack row to see how it interacts with the different type defenses.

Tap or click any highligted defense or attack to unhighlight it.

# FAQ
## Why
I spent too many days running dens in Sword/Shield with my family and we were always checking type charts to make sure we were bringing in the best mon. I wanted a chart that could highlight rows and columns, and this is the result.

## Can you add/change this thing I really really want?
Maybe, maybe not. This was literally just a whim project that I only work on when activly playing a Pokemon game. Forks and PRs are welcome though.
